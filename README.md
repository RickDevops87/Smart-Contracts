Smart Contracts Solidity 

SimpleStorage.sol

This is a clean and well-structured Solidity contract for a basic storage use case. Here's a quick breakdown of what it does:

Stores a single number (myFavoriteNumber).

Keeps a list of people (each with a name and favorite number).

Maps names to their favorite numbers for quick lookup.


Everything looks good! If you're planning to expand this, you might consider:

Adding events for store() and addPerson() for off-chain tracking.

Adding a function to remove or update a personâ€™s data.

Making myFavoriteNumber public if you want automatic getter functionality.
